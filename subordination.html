			<h2>Subordination to Ideals</h2>

					In my previous blogs I've talked about how one's ideals are a product of the society one grew up in, and how they are the basis of one's relationship with oneself. I've claimed that "Self-love'', or "Self-worth'' are precisely the product of the ideals one was able to satisfy, and how perverted one is relatively to those ideals. That is what I called "The medium of Judgement: how one sees oneself through the lens of The Other''. The Medium of Judgement is precisely "The Other'' internalized and integrated as an essential part of oneself.

The ideals prevalent in our time are a product of the capitalist mode of production, They are the relation between humans and the economy, they are what we as subjects make of the economy. Those ideals are necessary to keep things going, and hence become
"Ideology''.

The working class prioritizes productivity, as their self-worth is  economic-worth. The bourgeoisie doesn't need a notion of economic-worth, as they don't need self-worth. Self-worth is only important in the working class, where one strives to be as productive as possible, it can be said that "The Other'' here is precisely the bourgeois. Self-worth is the commodification of oneself. One commodifies oneself and compares his worth to other's worth, purely as a commodity waiting to be sold. Here it can truly be said that the worker sells himself daily and hourly. The worker represses his feelings of violence towards the "The Other'' to please the ideal of oneself as a productive agent. This is precisely why a revolution fails, not because we are bound to be slaves to the bourgeoisie but because we are bound to be slaves to the bourgeoisie in ourselves, the bourgeoisie as our "Medium of Judgement''. The worker convinces himself that the current state of things are necessary, that the exploitation of his labor is necessary for the machine to keep going. That is how he pleases his Medium of Judgement, by asserting its necessity. To overthrow "The Other'', a revolution should take place against one's Medium of Judgement.

		 In my first blog "Ideals and repression", I spoke about how an escape of our ideals is essentially escaping life.
		 This is what the working class fears. That life as we know it, the traditions we are accustomed to, the routine of our
		 everyday life, are about to vanish. We are afraid of escaping life as we know it, we are of course, afraid of the unknown.
		 What Ideals should we subordinate ourselves to?
