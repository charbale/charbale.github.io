			<p>The question of the purpose of life can only be answered transcendentally, usually with religion. I want to try to write about what does it mean to ask this question of purpose, and what other questions are synonymous to it, and whether one should ask himself that question, and what to expect for an answer. All philosophies arguably have one goal; To make one's life more enjoyable, to make it worth living. Even if the philosophy was fully life denying, the philosopher himself was affirming his own life writing that same book that was encouraging life denying philosophies, he himself saw his life's purpose in that book he's writing, yet he was telling people how to live their own purposeless lives, behind the curtain of his passion which he called his life's purpose yet never expressed it explicitly so.

People generally have an ideal they like to work themselves towards, a person they would like to see themselves become, but in that process of following their ideal they consequently risk being dishonest with themselves, usually to satisfy their perception of themselves as working towards or becoming that ideal. We see that in many different places, may it be when we look in the mirror, or when we hope for a better future. People take on ideals which they would judge themselves accordingly to, they call it their aesthetic, they live aesthetically, they celebrate aesthetically, they even suffer aesthetically. Those aesthetic people, as I like to call them, lack the only virtue in life which I would accept as such, honesty with oneself. I accept that virtue not for its own sake, but for the sake of living a fulfilling and happy life. But now we have to ask, why do people do this? Sartre said "Hell is other people", Wittgenstein then said "Hell isn't other people. Hell is yourself", but then I might add, Hell is yourself as other people. Imagine you are looking yourself in the mirror, you simultaneously judge your image of yourself through society's or people's lens, the mirror itself here acts as a medium of judgment. Here we see now how we formed the ideal, the ideal that one wants oneself to become is exactly the image they want to see in the mirror, physically and mentally so. Now the only question that is left to ask is, what is the ideal that one forms, based on? That question itself is synonymous to the question of is one's life worth living. When any person forms an ideal they would like to see themselves as, they directly say to themselves that their life is only worth living in pursuit of that ideal, and not otherwise. That is exactly why people are dishonest with themselves, they idealize a perception of themselves through the medium of judgment, then judge their life's worth based on that ideal. They would rather remain in the illusion they have of the idealized version of themselves that they can't imagine their life without, here they answer the question of their life's worth, without that ideal version they would rather cease to exist. Here we see the hell you put yourself into as you look at yourself through the mirror, but what about the heaven? The good side or the "Heaven" of that Idealized version oneself has, is found when one works towards that ideal and is honestly happy with oneself about it, meaning, they feel satisfied with what they are working towards, they feel as though that ideal they have of themselves is now not much of an ideal, more a reality. Here I am hesitant to say this, but I think life is no more than that, a flux between the ideal one judges himself to be, and the journey one spends trying to meet that ideal. As Sartre's play "No Exit" in which he famously said "Hell is other people", there was no escape, and here too, there is no escape of that ideal one holds himself up to, it is an inevitable fact of life which one should never try to escape but rather satisfy. People even love ideally, and they do so by choosing someone they think approves of the ideal they have held their significant other up to, whether it is physically or mentally. But does that make love any less true? People love for different reasons, but one thing is well known, they do so selfishly. Love is the most selfish act that a human is ever capable of, and it is absurd to say otherwise. Back to how people love ideally, they do so by falling in love with the person who is the closest to that ideal, essentially falling in love with how they think their lover is supposed to act not how they truly want to act. Here motives play the most important role in anyone’s life, is someone doing what they are doing for the simple fact of satisfying the perception of the other on how one is supposed to act, or because they want to? Honesty with oneself about one’s motives are crucial in any action one takes, maybe “True love” is the acceptance of the other’s honest motives independent of ideals.

Now I have a question to ask, on why has society made it a virtue to not care what people think, when that ideal we spend our lives satisfying is itself a product of the people, the society we grew up in. Here in a sense we are slaves to each other, and we do so because it is pleasurable. Life fulfillment is only possible in the sense that we judge ourselves based on societal standards of success or satisfaction, there is no escape from that, people who claim to not care what people think are exactly the people who try to escape forming an ideal for themselves to work towards, essentially escaping life. One's identity is only the product of society, nothing more, one forms his identity as that ideal, and that ideal is formed through the medium of judgment. It is perverted to even try to say one doesn't care about people, and even more perverted to be proud of it. But here let's not confuse priorities, one prioritizes what one cares about, what is one's ideal, it may not always be what society prioritizes, but it is still nonetheless dependent on society. The notion of not caring about anything comes at the expense of caring for something better, whatever one deems better, and never only by putting one's mind to caring less, which would only bring despair and nihilism since that ideal of not caring is synonymous to the ideal of non existence; death. Man would rather wish suffering upon himself rather than wish nothing. Consequently, people shame arrogance or ego, but ego is a byproduct of working towards an ideal, it is natural in the sense that it is inevitable. When one notices that ego, one should fully embrace it, as much as he embraces that ideal. As I have said, if life is that flux between the ideal one holds oneself up to, and ego is synonymous with life.

On suicide, rationally I am opposed to suicide no matter the situation, because when one feels the need to end their life they do so with the idea that they want to end their suffering, but suffering itself is a feeling, a sensation or a condition, and conditions or sensations presuppose existence, therefore, when one kills oneself they compare themselves to another sensation or condition they would rather be in, but since conditions or sensations presuppose existence, and death is the absence of existence, then rationally it doesn't make sense, but rationality is the last of one's worries.
