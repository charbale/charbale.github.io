The medium of judgement is essentially how one sees oneself through the lens of another person,
or society. It can be abstractly thought as a mirror where one looks into it and sees the eyes of
people looking back at him, here the individual judges himself by the opinions, or standards, of
these people. This act governs our lives in every aspect. We design our homes the way we think
people will see fit once they visit us, hence the term “decor”, we dress in a trendy way hence the
term fashion, we behave in a polite way hence the term “etiquette”. We do that with the intent
to conform, as it is desirable to belong rather than to be an outcast, for obvious survival reasons.
Traditions of a certain civilization are a perfect example of how useless an act can be as an act
itself but is done for the sake of conforming. Here we can think of the medium of judgement as
a cloud which we all live in and are actively conscious about it, but never dare to speak against
its absurdity. The absurdity of certain rituals become obvious when one notices that everyone else
also notices that absurdity but doesn’t rebel; hence the term “taboo”. This can be seen in rituals
of any kind, whether it is greeting someone, the way a mother disciplines her child.

A great pillar of civilization as pointed out by Freud, is the regulation of mutual relations between
man. Every person hitherto has certain expectations that he is conscious of, and strives to fulfilling
as a civilized man. A father and a mother both have expectations not only from their children but
from civilization (or society) on how they ought to raise their children. This is the first taming
from civilization we can see in a person’s life, a child is disciplined to reflect the image his parents
want to propagate about themselves to society through the child himself; The parent’s worth
is now resembled by their child. The parents now hope that their child adheres to the highest
virtue held by society as a means to prove their worth, the child is their medium of judgement.
Here an example of how the medium of judgement plays a role of conscience is clear: As their child
misbehaves it reflects on their medium of judgement; their conscience is now troubled. Punishment
is necessary to restore the child’s discipline, as a means to ease the parent’s conscience. Of course,
this is all trivial.

Conscience: What one ought to do, or think. The medium of judgement serves as a way for a
civilized man playing a part of civilization with a certain role to know what he ought to do. Here
the connection between the medium of judgement and conscience becomes clear: the medium of
judgement is how one sees oneself through the lens of society or a person and their conscience is
troubled as a consequence of them acting outside of how they ought to. By acting here I mean
literally acting, as in a physical act, or a thought. Here in a sense man is his own thought police,
one’s conscience is troubled when he thinks a thought that is deemed unthinkable by the medium
of judgement as it may lead to something he might never want to see himself become. Here one
becomes one’s worst enemy, as if a battle of two people happening inside one’s mind: The battle
of what one is expected to think and what one actually thinks. This battle is the hell with “No
Exit”, it even torments man in his solitude. One now only looks at the world through the lens
of that battle, searching for someone to express one’s feelings to as a means to comfort oneself.
What makes this hell even harder is that, it is rarely the case that one can find a civilized man
who will be able to step outside what is expected of him and express his hell too, from the fear
of shame. Here I think love plays an important role, two people who know each other outside of
their respective mediums of judgements, in a sense the only escape is found in the other.

Guilt is what one feels when his conscience is troubled, he is afraid that he would be known
for stepping outside what he ought to act or think. Sexuality is a field where we can see this
happen a lot, as it is really broad. In our postmodern world, when people realized the absurdity
of civilization and what it imposes on man sexually, a sort of sexual revolution has happened.
Homosexuality, or any other sexual act that as a man or a woman one ought not to enjoy or
even think about, is seen as a revolution against the medium of judgement that has hitherto been
imposed on a person’s sexual enjoyement. A man loving a woman was what a man ought to do,
and vice versa. Homosexuality is the step outside of what the medium of judgement has imposed
on one of the sexes as what they ought to enjoy. Guilt is natural to follow (Natural in the sense
of inevitable), when one steps outside of the medium of judgement, hence the repression of one’s
sexual thoughts as a means to satisfy one’s conscience through the medium of judgement takes
place. When homosexuals realized that repression is not a solution but a prolongation of their
suffering, they search for people with common suffering to belong. As a way to get rid of the guilt
one’s conscience suffers from because of his sexual tendencies, change in society is essential to alter
the medium of judgement. Acceptance by other people now becomes of the highest virtue to a
homosexual, as it ultimately means his acceptance of himself.

As I was writing this paper I was also reading Freud’s Civilization and its Discontents. In chapter
7, Freud outlines the oncept of the superego, the superego is precisely the medium of judgement. It
is how one sees onself, as an ideal. The superego is a product of civilization, it acts as an authority
inwards, as i have said, as conscience. It is responsible for the feeling of “guilt”. As I have talked
about in [II], this starts within a child’s development, the feeling of guilt is a product of the
parent’s authority. The authority hence is satisfied once the Child renounces his instincts, here the
distinction between the thought and action is important too, the authority is satisfied once the child
stops doing the action that the authority (Parental figures) deemed impolite. That authority takes
on later in the form of an internal one; Superego as Conscience. The most important difference
between those two forms of authority is that the supergo is inescapable as it is also only a thought
that will inspire the feeling of guilt. Thoughtpolice as an external force isn’t needed when we all
have a superego that polices our thoughts. Now the question lies on why do we feel that guilt?
The answer is simple, it is the fear we feel of not being loved anymore. It is the Eros instinct as
freud says, that we fear. We fear, as I have pointed out, of becoming outcasts. Depending on what
Medium of judgement is the person judging himself through, stems our fear from being shunned
by someone or society at large. To further ask the question of why do we fear being outcasts or
not loved, is merely a matter of survival.
