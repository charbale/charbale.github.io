		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>I'm reading Capital vol. 1, so I'll be summarizing the chapters and my notes here. Of course it goes
			without saying I'm not an expert on this, so do your own reading and use this blog as reference. You can find the pdf
			version <a href="https://charbale.github.io/capital/capital.pdf">here</a>.</p>

				<p> "The best points in my book are: (1) The two-fold character of labour, according to whether it is expressed in
					use-value or exchange value. (All understanding of the facts depends on this). It is emphasized immediately, in the
					first chapter; (2) The treatment of surplus value independently of its particular forms as profit, interest, ground
					rent, etc. This will come out especially in the second volume. The treatment of the particular forms by classical
					economy, which always mixes them up with the general form, is a regular hash." </p>
